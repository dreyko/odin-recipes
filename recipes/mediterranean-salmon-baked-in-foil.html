    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Mediterranean salmon, baked in foil packets with olives, artichokes, tomatoes, and Mediterranean seasonings, stays moist and tender, and cleanup is minimal.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (12x16-inch) rectangles aluminum foil</li>
        <li>4 (6 to 8 ounce) salmon filets</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Greek seasoning</li>
        <li>1 cup diced cherry or grape tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 marinated artichoke hearts, quartered</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced red onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons halved, pitted Kalamata olives</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, zested and juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush the center of each foil rectangle with a small amount of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Place a salmon filet in the center of each foil sheet. Brush filets lightly with olive oil; sprinkle with Greek seasoning.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine tomatoes, artichokes, onion, olives, lemon zest and juice, minced parsley, balsamic vinegar, garlic, red pepper flakes, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spoon tomato mixture evenly over filets. Pull the long ends of foil rectangles over filets and fold twice to crimp, with the foil not touching the contents. Lift each end of the packet and pinch closed. Place packets on a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes. An instant read thermometer, inserted into the center of filets through the foil packet, should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To serve, place foil packs on serving plates. Open packets, drizzle with any remaining olive oil, garnish with parsley sprigs, and serve with lemon wedges.</li>        
    </ol>
